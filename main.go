func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}

// This is a simple Go program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
// It serves as a basic example of a Go application structure.
// To run this program, save it in a file named main.go and execute the command:
// go run main.go
// The program uses the "fmt" package to handle formatted I/O operations.
// The main function is the entry point of the program, where execution begins.
// The fmt.Println function is used to output the string to the console.
// This code can be extended with more functionality as needed.
// The program is structured to be easily readable and maintainable.
// Ensure you have Go installed on your machine to run this code.
// You can modify the string in fmt.Println to print different messages.
// This code is a good starting point for learning Go programming.
